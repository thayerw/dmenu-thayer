# dmenu-thayer

This repository contains my customizations to dmenu, a dynamic menu for X.

## Patches

Currently, the only patch applied is [line height](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/line-height/).

## Installation

For instructions on how to install and run dmenu, see the upstream [README](https://github.com/thayerwilliams/dmenu-thayer/blob/master/README), or visit <https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/>. My configuration has no additional requirements beyond what is normally needed to build and execute dwm.
